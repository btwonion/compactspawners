# compactspawners
> Fabric/Quilt mod which allows you to use spawners as a fully automatic farm

This is accomplished via merged spawners and automatic mob killing and storing

## Roadmap
- hopper support
- performance improvements, especially cleaning up inventory-gui (own quick move logic)
- optional custom gui
- fix glass panes moving out of the inventory
- improve design
- fixing the gui would be nice too :)

## Other
⚠️ The development version is always the latest stable release of minecraft. 
Therefore, new features will only be available for the current and following minecraft versions.
